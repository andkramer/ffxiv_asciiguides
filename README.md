# Mini ASCII Guides for Final Fantasy XIV

# Who am i?
I'm Myhazael, developer for a big telecommunication company and a huge fan of Final Fantasy XIV. I play FFXIV on Omega@Chaos since the release of Shadowbringers and want to spread some of my little knowledge i acquired in this game due to this repository.

# What can you find here?

Since i am really bad at writing good looking guides, i though i might just use that, which i am the most used to: Writing readable stuff in good old ascii text format.
